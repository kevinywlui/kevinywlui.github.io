{"type":"cell","id":"deb1ad","pos":4,"input":"**Computation:** There is a thing called cofactor expansion. It is terrible but we will learn it. In practice, another method is used like $LU$-decomposition. There $LU$ decompositon of a matrix $A$ is $A=LU$ where $L$ is lower trianguluar and $U$ is upper triangular. Then $\\det(A)=\\det(L)\\det(U)$, where $\\det(L)$ and $\\det(U)$ is the product of the diagonal. Give $n=2$ and $n=3$ shortcuts and the general cofactor formula.
