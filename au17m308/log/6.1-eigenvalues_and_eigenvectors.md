# Eigenvalues and Eigenspaces

(insert picture of what a eigenvector is)

**Definition:** Let $A$ be a $n\times n$ matrix. Then a nonzero vector $u$ is
an *eigenvector* if there exists a scalar $\lambda$ such that $Au=\lambda u$.
The scalar $\lambda$ here is called the *eigenvalue*. Here $u$ is an eigenvector
associated to $\lambda$.

**Examples:**

* What are the eigenvalues and eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix?
* What are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of problem 3 on the midterm?
* What are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of reflection across a plane?
* Let $A=[[3,5],[4,2]]$. Determine if each of the following is an eigenvector
  for $A$. $u_1=(5,4),u_2=(4,-1),u_3=(-1,1)$.

**Theorem**
A square matrix is invertible if and only if $0$ is not a eigenvalue.

**Theorem/Definition:**
Let $A$ be a $n\times n$ matrix with eigenvalue $\lambda$. Then the set of all
eigenvectors associated to $\lambda$ along with $0$ forms a subspace, called
the *eigenspace*, of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is also the null space of $A-\lambda
I$.

**Theorem/Definition:**
Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. Then $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue if and only
if $\det(A-\lambda I)=0$. The polynomial $\det(A-\lambda I)$ is called the
*charateristic polynomial* of $A$. The *multiplicity* of a eigenvalue is its
multiplicity in the charateristic polynomial.

**Example:**
Find the eigenvalues and a basis for each eigenspace for
$A=[[0,2,-1],[1,-1,0],[1,-2,0]]$.

It turns out that $\det(A-\lambda I)$ is
$-\lambda^3-\lambda^2+\lambda+1=-(\lambda-1)(\lambda+1)^2$.

So we are just finding the basis for the nullspaces of $A-I$ and $A+I$ which we
can do with row reductions.

**Theorem:**
Let $A$ be a square matrix with eigenvalue $\lambda$. Then the dimension of the
associated eigenspace is less than or equal to the multiplicty of $\lambda$.
