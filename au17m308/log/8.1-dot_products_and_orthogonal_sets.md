# 8.1 Dot Products and Orthogonal Sets

**Definition:** Suppose that $u=(u_1,\ldots,u_n)$ and $v=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ are
both vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the *dot product* of $u$ and $v$ is
$u\cdot v = u_1v_1+\ldots+u_nv_n$.

**Theorem:** Let $u,v,w$ be in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the dot product has the
following properties:

* (Symmetry) $u\cdot v = v\cdot u$,
* (Linearity) $(cu+v)\cdot w = cu\cdot w + v\cdot w$,
* (Positive Definite) $u\cdot u\geq 0$ for all $u$, and $u\cdot u=0$ if and and
  only if $u=0$.

**Definition:** Let $x$ be a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the *norm* of $x$
is given by $\|x\|=\sqrt{x\cdot x}$. Note that $\|cx\|=|c|\|x\|$. 

For two vectors $u$ and $v$, the *distance* between $u$ and $v$ is given by
$\|u-v\|$.

**Definition:** Let $u$ and $v$ be vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are *orthogonal*
if $u\cdot v=0$.

**Theorem:** (Pythagorean Theorem) Suppose that $u$ and $v$ are in
$\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\|u+v\|^2=\|u\|^2+\|v\|^2$ if and only if $u\cdot v=0$.

**Theorem:** (Triangle Inequality) If $u$ and $v$ are in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then
$\|u+v\|\leq \|u\|+\|v\|$.

**Definition:** Let $S$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. A vector $u$ is
*orthogonal* to $S$ if it is orthogonal to every vector in $S$. The set of all
vectors orthogonal to $S$ is called the *orthogonal complement* of $S$ and is
denoted $S^\perp$. 

The orthogonal complement to a subspace is also a subspace.

**Theorem:** Let $B=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ be a basis for a subspace $S$. Then
$u\in S^\perp$ ($u$ is orthogonal to $S$) if and only if $u$ is orthogonal to
each $v_i$.

**Example:** Let $s_1=(1,0,-1)$ and $s_2=(1,1,1)$ and $S$ be the span of $s_1$
and $s_2$. Is $u=(-1,1,1)\in S^\perp$? What is a basis for $S^\perp$?

**Definition:** A set of vectors $V$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ form an *orthogonal set*
the vectors are pairwise orthogonal. This means that if $v_i$ and $v_j$ are
distinct vectors in $V$, then $v_i\cdot v_j=0$.

**Example:**

* Is the standard basis an orthogonal set?
* What's a basis that is not orthogonal?

**Theorem:** An orthogonal set of nonzero vectors is linearly independent.

**Definition:** A basis that is orthogonal as a set is called an *orthogonal
basis*. A basis that is orthogonal as a set and is comprised of vectors of norm
1 is called an *orthonormal basis*.

**Theorem:** Let $S$ be a subspace with orthogonal basis $\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$.
Then any vector $s\in S$ can be written as a linear combination
$v=c_1v_1+\ldots+c_kv_k$ with $c_i=v_i\cdot s/\|v_i\|^2$.

**Example:**
Let $v_1=(-2,1,1), v_2=(1,-1,-3), v_3=(4,7,-1)$. Write $(3,-1,5)$ as a linear
combination of $v_i$.
