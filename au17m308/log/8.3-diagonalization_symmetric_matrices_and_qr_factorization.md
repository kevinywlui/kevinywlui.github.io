# Diagonalization Symmetric Matrices and QR factorization

**Theorem:** If $A$ is a symmetric matrix, then eigenvectors associated to
distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.

**Definition:** A square matrix $P$ with orthonormal columns is called an
orthogonal matrix.

**Theorem:** If $P$ is a square orthonormal matrix then $P$ is invertible and
the inverse is the transpose - $P^{-1}=P^t$.

Proof: Let $P=[p_1\; \ldots\; p_n]$. Then the $ij$th entry of $P^tP$ is
$p_i\cdot p_j$ which is 1 if $i=j$ and is $0$ if $i\neq j$.

**Questions:**

* What is the determinant of an orthogonal matrix? What does it tell you
  geometrically?
* Is every matrix with determinant $\pm 1$ orthogonal?
* How would you invert an orthogonal matrix?

## Orthogonally Diagonalizable Matrices

**Definition:** A square matrix $A$ is orthogonally diagonalizable if there
exists an orthogonal matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that
$A=PDP^{-1}=PDP^t$.

(give an example in class.)

**Theorem:** (Spectral Theorem) A matrix $A$ is orthogonally diagonalizable if
and only if $A$ is symmetric.

It is easy to see that if $A$ is orthogonally diagonalizable then $A$ is
symmetric. The converse is harder and won't be proved in this class.

## QR Factorization

**Theorem:** (QR factorization) Let $A=[a_1\;\ldots\;a_m$ be an $n\times m$
matrix with linearly independent columns. Then $A$ can be factored as $A=QR$
where $Q$ is a $n\times m$ matrix with orthonormal columns and $R$ is an
$m\times m$ matrix with nonnegative diagonal.

See the book for a full proof.

The matrix $Q=[q_1\; \ldots\; q_m]$ is obtained by the Gram-Schmidt process. We
can then obtain $R$ by computing $Q^tA=R$. This $R$ will be upper triangular
but the entries on the diagonal could be negative. But we can fix it.

This is useful for solving linear systems. Pivot manipulations can cause
significant roundoff errors. 

If $Ax=b$ and $A=QR$, then $QRx = b$ so $Rx=Q^tb$. This is now a triangular
system which can be solved with backsubstituion.
