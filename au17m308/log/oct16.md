* Midterm on Wednesday

## Review

Talk about some worksheet solutions.

Give an example of each of the following. If it is not possible, write "NOT
POSSIBLE".

* Give an example of a linear system with no solutions
* Give an example of a linear system with infinitely many solutions
* Give an example of 4 vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are linearly independent.
* Give an example of 3 vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are spanning.
* Give an example of a linear transformation $T:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$
  such that $T(3,0)=(2,3)$.
* Give an example of a linear transformation $T:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3$
  that is onto.

Let $v_1=(1,0,0,0), v_2=(1,2,0,0), v_3=(2,3,4,0), v_4=(1,2,3,0)$. Let
$S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.

* Is $S$ a spanning set? If not, what is a vector not in the span?
* Is $S$ a linearly independent set? If not, write one of the vectors as a
  linear combination of the others.
* Let $A=[v_1\;v_2\;v_3\;v_4]$. Give a nontrivial solution to $Ax=0$.
* Let $T$ be the linear transformation defined by $T(x)=Ax$. What is the
  dimension of the domain and codomain of $T$?
* Is $T$ one-to-one? Why or why not?
* Is $T$ onto? Why or why not?

And then we go over old midterms.
