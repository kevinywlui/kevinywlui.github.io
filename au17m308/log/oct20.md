## 3.2 Matrix Algebra

### Addition and scale multiplication

We can add and scale multiply matrices by pretending they are vectors. This has
all the nice properties vectors have. See 3.11 in the book.

### Matrix mutliplication

Let $A$ be an $n\times k$ matrix and $B=[b_1 \; b_2 \; \ldots \; b_m]$ be a
$k\times m$. We define the product $AB=[Ab_1 \; Ab_2 \; \ldots \; Ab_m]$ which
is an $n \times m$ matrix. 

Do an example in class.

The identity matrix is a thing. Here it is.

### Properties of Matrix Algbera

* $A(BC) = (AB)C$
* $A(B+C)=AB+AC$
* $(A+B)C=AC+BC$
* $s(AB) = (sA)B=A(sB)$
* $AI=A$
* $IA=A$

The key thing to know is that $AB\neq BA$ and that $AB=0$ does not imply $A=0$
or $B=0$.

Matrix multiplication are important because they correspond to composition of
linear functions. Do example in class. Write this as a theorem?

### Traspose are a thing

You flip the rows and columns. The key things to know are

* $(A+B)^t$
* $(sA)^t = sA^t$
* $(AC)^t = C^tA^t$

### Diaginal matrices are a thing

### Elementary matrices are a thing

Elementary matices are the matrices that correpond to elementary row
operations. Figure them out with class. It'll be fun. 


### Block multiplication

They are a thing. You feel great them you get it to work.
