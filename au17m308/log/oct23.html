<h3 id="diaginal-matrices-are-a-thing">Diaginal matrices are a thing</h3>
<p>Multiplication is awesome! Won’t it be great if every matrix was diagonal.</p>
<h3 id="elementary-matrices-are-a-thing">Elementary matrices are a thing</h3>
<p>Elementary matices are the matrices that correpond to elementary row operations. Figure them out with class. It’ll be fun.</p>

<p>They are a thing. You feel great them you get it to work.</p>

<p>We can think of <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><em>B</em></span> as <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> acting on <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> or as <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> acting on <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>. We can demonstrate this with diagonal matrices. here it is.</p>

<p>What does invertible mean?</p>
<p>When is a linear transform <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> invertible?</p>
<p>What are some obvious transform that are not invertible?</p>
<p>What are some obvious transform that are invertible?</p>
<p>What are some obvious inverses we can figure out?</p>
<p>How can we compute this inverse?</p>
