<h3 id="linear-equation">Linear equation</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>linear equation</em> is an equation of the form <span class="math display">\[c_1 x_1 + c_2
x_2 + \ldots + c_n x_n = d\]</span>, where the (c_i)'s are constants and the <span class="math display">\[x_i\]</span>'s are variables. The solutions to a linear equation are the possible <span class="math display">\[x\]</span>'s that satisfy the equation.</p>
<p>When we talk about solutions of linear equations, we have an ambient space in mind. In other words, the number of variables should be specified. For example, <span class="math display">\[6x=5\]</span> can be considered a linear equation in just <span class="math display">\[x\]</span>, or in <span class="math display">\[x,y\]</span>. The space of solutions will depend on this.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> * <span class="math display">\[6x=5\]</span>: The solution space in <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{R}\]</span> is a point. The solution space in <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{R}^2\]</span> is a linear. * <span class="math display">\[3x+2y=6\]</span>: Think about solution space. * <span class="math display">\[4x+2y+z=0\]</span>: Think about solution space.</p>
<p>We can see that geometrically, the solution space will a point, a line, a plane, or some other straight object.</p>
<h3 id="systems-of-linear-equations">Systems of linear equations</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>system of linear equations</em> is a list of linear equations. The solutions to a system of linear equation is the possible <span class="math display">\[x\]</span>'s that satisfy all linear equations on the list.</p>
<p>The solution space of a system of linear equations is the intersection of the solution space to each linear equation in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> The number of solutions to a system of linear equations will be either zero, one, or infinity.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A system of linear equations is said to be <em>consistent</em> is there exist at least one solution. It is <em>inconsistent</em> if it is not consistent.</p>
