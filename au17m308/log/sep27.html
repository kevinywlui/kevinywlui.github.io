<h3 id="linear-equation">Linear equation</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>linear equation</em> is an equation of the form <br /><span class="math display"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub><em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>c</em><sub>2</sub><em>x</em><sub>2</sub> + … + <em>c</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>d</em></span><br />, where the <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>’s are constants and the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>’s are variables. The solutions to a linear equation are the possible <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>’s that satisfy the equation.</p>
<p>When we talk about solutions of linear equations, we have an ambient space in mind. In other words, the number of variables should be specified. For example, <span class="math inline">6<em>x</em> = 5</span> can be considered a linear equation in just <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, or in <span class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span>. The space of solutions will depend on this.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">6<em>x</em> = 5</span>: The solution space in <span class="math inline">ℝ</span> is a point. The solution space in <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>2</sup></span> is a linear.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">3<em>x</em> + 2<em>y</em> = 6</span>: Think about solution space.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">4<em>x</em> + 2<em>y</em> + <em>z</em> = 0</span>: Think about solution space.</p></li>
<li><p>An equation in <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> variables yeilds a <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>-dimensional space.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that geometrically, the solution space will a point, a line, a plane, or some other straight object.</p>
<h3 id="systems-of-linear-equations">Systems of linear equations</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>system of linear equations</em> is a list of linear equations. The solutions to a system of linear equation is the possible <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>’s that satisfy all linear equations on the list.</p>
<p>The solution space of a system of linear equations is the intersection of the solution space to each linear equation in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> The number of solutions to a system of linear equations will be either zero, one, or infinity.</p>
<p>The number of soluitions can be determined. In this course, we will learn how.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Think of some examples here with class.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A system of linear equations is said to be <em>consistent</em> is there exist at least one solution. It is <em>inconsistent</em> if it is not consistent.</p>
<h3 id="special-forms-of-linear-systems">Special forms of linear systems</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Given an ordering of the variables, the <em>leading variable</em> of a linear equation is the first variable with a nonzero coefficient in that linear equation.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>square</em> linear system of equation is a linear system of equation with the same number of variables and equations.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A square linear system of equation is <em>triangular</em> if the leading variable of the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th equation is <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Think of some examples here with class. Remember to solve them with back substitution.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A linear system is in <em>echelon form</em> if the leading variable are strictly increasing from top to bottom. Equations without variables are place at the bottom. In such a linear system, any variable that is not a leading variable is called a <em>free variable</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Think of some examples here with class. Be sure to explain why a free variable is called a free variable.</p>
