<li><p>Find all solutions to the linear sytem of equations given by Example 3 in Section 1.2 in the book. If you’re tired of solving linear systems, just look up the answer in the book. </p></li>
<li><p>Explicitly write down 2 solutions. In other words, write down 2 points with actual numbers that solve the linear system.</p></li>
<li><p>Find all solutions the homogenous linear system given by  This is pretty much the same linear system but with the right hand side replaced by zeros.</p></li>
<li><p>Call the 2 solutions you found earlier <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>. Does <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> − <em>b</em></span> solve the homogenous linear system? The answer should be yes. Can you explain why?</p></li>
