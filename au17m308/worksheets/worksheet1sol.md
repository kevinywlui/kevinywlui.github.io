# Worksheet 1

## Section 1.1
* Are all triangular systems echelon? If not, write down a triangular system
  that is not echelon.

Yes.

* Are all echelon systems triangular? If not, write down a echelon system that
  is not triangular.

No. Consider the system consisting of the single equation $0=0$.

## Section 1.2
* Find all solutions to the linear sytem of equations given by Example 3 in
  Section 1.2 in the book. If you're tired of solving linear systems, just look
  up the answer in the book.
  \begin{align}
    2x_1 - 3x_2 + 10x_3 &= -2\\
    x_1-2x_2 +3x_3 &= -2 \\
    -x_1 +3x_2 +x_3 &=4.
  \end{align}

$(x_1,x_2,x_3)=(2,2,0)+s_1(-11,-4,1)$.

* Explicitly write down 2 solutions. In other words, write down 2 points with
  actual numbers that solve the linear system.

$(2,2,0), (-9, -2, 1)$.

* Find all solutions the homogenous linear system given by
  \begin{align}
    2x_1 - 3x_2 + 10x_3 &= 0\\
    x_1-2x_2 +3x_3 &= 0 \\
    -x_1 +3x_2 +x_3 &=0.
  \end{align}
  This is pretty much the same linear system but with the right hand side
  replaced by zeros.

$(x_1,x_2,x_3)=s_1(-11,-4,1)$.

* Call the 2 solutions you found earlier $a$ and $b$. Does $a-b$ solve the
  homogenous linear system? The answer should be yes. Can you explain why?

Yes. See homegenous solutions section.
