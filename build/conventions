Gerber: over a strong notrump bid, a jump to 4 clubs asks for aces. 4D shows 0 or 4; 4H shows 1; 4S shows 2; 4N shows 3. A followup bid of 5 clubs asks for king count, with the same steps (first step is 0/4, subsequent steps are 1,2,3 respectively). 

Support double: opener can double an overcall by the opponents to show support for partner's bid suit. E.g. 1D, P, 1H, 1S, X shows 3 card support for partner's hearts. 

Fourth suit forcing: in an uncontested auction, if four different suits have been bid in succession, the last bid is artificial and unconditionally forcing to game. E.g. 1H, 1S, 2D, 3C is game forcing, not necessarily showing clubs. 

Cappelletti (defense against 1NT): When the opponents open 1NT, in direct seat or after 1NT, P, P, overcalls at the 2 level have the following meanings: X is for penalty; 2C shows a single suited hand, and requires partner to bid 2D (any other suit is signoff, 2NT is invitational to game); 2H shows hearts and a minor (should be at least 5 hearts and 4 of the minor); 2S shows spades and a minor (should be at least 5 spades and 4 of the minor); 2NT shows 5-5 in the minor suits. 

Puppet Stayman: responding to a 2NT opening bid, or over the sequence 2C, P, 2D, P, 2NT. 3C is 'Puppet stayman,' to be bid with an invitational or game forcing hand with a four card major. Opener bids 3D with no 5 card major, or 3H/S with 5 cards in that suit. Over 3D, responder bids 3 of the major he doesn't have a 4 card suit in (or chooses one if he is 4-4 in the majors).
