# Kevin Lui

* I am a 5th-year graduate student working with [William
  Stein](http://wstein.org/). 
* My research is in computations relating to modular abelian varieties.
  Recently, I've been thinking a lot about Galois representations and
  isogenies.
* I like [sage-ing](http://www.sagemath.org/), math-ing, and climbing.
