# Log

Here exists a log that I use to remind myself what to cover in class. The main
audience is me. It might not be thorough. It might not make sense. It might not
be helpful. It might be full of lies. However, I'm already writing it for
myself so I might as well share it.

## 04/17

- Convince them that linear transformations are determined by what they do to
  the standard basis.
- Convince them that every linear transformation comes from a matrix.
- Do this <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct11.pdf>
- If time, Kernel and ranges.


## 04/15

- Make a really big table. LI/Spanning/dims
- Equivalent definitions of spanning, LI
- Unifying theorem
- If time, <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct09.pdf> and
  <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct11.pdf>

## 04/12

- Introduce Ax=b, as just linear combinations.
- Uniqueness of solutions given by homogeneous solutions
- Mention how LI and spanning relates to existence and uniqueness of solutions
- Do unifying theorem
- Do many many examples in class

## 04/10

- PS 2 is out
- Tell them about Ax=b
- Show them
  <https://cocalc.com/projects/ed9c7f20-1bf8-477b-96e4-2620d084978f/files/Sagemath.ipynb?session=default> 
- Go through <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct06.pdf>

## 04/08

- reduce echelon forms are unique.
- Chapter 1 Conceptual problems are due with Chapter 2 next Friday.
- Go through: <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct04.pdf>
- In general, talk a lot of about spans.
- Linear combinations of linear combinations are linear combinations of
  original thing.
  - Use this to motivate span of two non-parallel vectors being RR^2.
  - Does this work for RR3? No.


## 04/05

- Tell class to watch 3blue1blue video 1
- Tell class that the Chapter 1 of conceptual problems are out
- Do example here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination>
- Do Problem 1 here: <http://kevinlui.org/m308exams/au17_midterm1.pdf>
- Point out what a homogenous solution is
- Tell them what a particular solution is
- Give a math 126 example
- 2.1
- Tell them what a vector is. It has nice properties. See book.
- 2.2
- Go through this: <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct04.pdf>

## 04/03

- Talk about changes to conceptual problems.
- Now have a Canvas.
- There will be a stranger in OH, but it'll be okay
- Triangular implies echelon
- Go through <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/sep29.pdf>
    - multiply by 2 on the first row

## 04/01

- Basic info
    - This is my name, OH, email.
    - Syllabus is online
        - Here is the grading scale
        - Here is the exam schedule
        - Please don't miss exams
        - Homework is webassign + conceptual questions
        - The conceptual questions are due on the Fridays on week 3,5,7,9
        - The week 3 one will be assigned this Friday
    - First webassign thing is due Thursday.
    - WA office hours are 11-3, 4/4 and 4/8 in the MSC
