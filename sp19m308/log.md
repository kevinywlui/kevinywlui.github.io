# Log

Here exists a log that I use to remind myself what to cover in class. The main
audience is me. It might not be thorough. It might not make sense. It might not
be helpful. It might be full of lies. However, I'm already writing it for
myself so I might as well share it.

## 05/13

- Left multiplication affects rows 
- Row operations yields invertible matrices
- Rank and nullity doesn't change when multiplied by invertible matrices
- talk a bit about change of basis

## 05/10

## 05/08

- Thursday office hours moved to 4-5
- Basis. How to find. Row and column methods.
- Membership testing.

## 05/06

- Thursday office hours moved to 4-5

## 05/03

- 3blue1brown 7,8.
- Conceptual problems due in a week.
- More matrix multiplication is function composition.
- Despite what Webassign said to do, inverse to solve system is not that great
  of an idea. (send to class?
  <https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/01/19/dont-invert-that-matrix/>)
  - it's slow
  - numerical stability reasons.
  - inverse can be dense when if original is not.
- 1b from <http://kevinlui.org/m308exams/au17_midterm2.pdf>
- Inverses are unique.
- R2 to 3 to 2, one-sided inverse thing
- Subspaces: http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct27.pdf

## 05/01

- More matrix multiplication
- Matrix multiplication is function composition
- Inverses. Wow you folks already learned this secretly. Nice.

## 04/29

- Conceptual Problems Set 2 posted, due May 10 - use camscanner
- Watch 3blue1brown, 4
- Go over low median problems, 1.3, 2.3, 3.4, 5.2 
- Go over matrix multiplication. Do row stuff too.
- <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct20.pdf>

## 04/26

- There was a midterm

## 04/24

- Solutions are posted on canvas. 
- Midterm on Friday, up to and including 3.1. 
- Be sure to understand conceptual problems.
- Do the derivate thing and talk about the kernel...wow integration!
- Relate to the conceptual problem related the derivatives. 
- Do more past exam problems, take from Finals.

## 04/22

- Mostly exam review
- Probably do past exam problems.
- Do a cool a problem that involves having to solve a linear system and then
  stick it into a matrix. 

## 04/17

- Convince them that linear transformations are determined by what they do to
  the standard basis.
- Convince them that every linear transformation comes from a matrix.
- Do this <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct11.pdf>
- If time, Kernel and ranges.


## 04/15

- Make a really big table. LI/Spanning/dims
- Equivalent definitions of spanning, LI
- Unifying theorem
- If time, <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct09.pdf> and
  <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct11.pdf>

## 04/12

- Introduce Ax=b, as just linear combinations.
- Uniqueness of solutions given by homogeneous solutions
- Mention how LI and spanning relates to existence and uniqueness of solutions
- Do unifying theorem
- Do many many examples in class

## 04/10

- PS 2 is out
- Tell them about Ax=b
- Show them
  <https://cocalc.com/projects/ed9c7f20-1bf8-477b-96e4-2620d084978f/files/Sagemath.ipynb?session=default> 
- Go through <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct06.pdf>

## 04/08

- reduce echelon forms are unique.
- Chapter 1 Conceptual problems are due with Chapter 2 next Friday.
- Go through: <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct04.pdf>
- In general, talk a lot of about spans.
- Linear combinations of linear combinations are linear combinations of
  original thing.
  - Use this to motivate span of two non-parallel vectors being RR^2.
  - Does this work for RR3? No.


## 04/05

- Tell class to watch 3blue1blue video 1
- Tell class that the Chapter 1 of conceptual problems are out
- Do example here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination>
- Do Problem 1 here: <http://kevinlui.org/m308exams/au17_midterm1.pdf>
- Point out what a homogenous solution is
- Tell them what a particular solution is
- Give a math 126 example
- 2.1
- Tell them what a vector is. It has nice properties. See book.
- 2.2
- Go through this: <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/oct04.pdf>

## 04/03

- Now have a Canvas.
- There will be a stranger in OH, but it'll be okay
- Triangular implies echelon
- Go through <http://kevinlui.org/au17m308/log/sep29.pdf>
