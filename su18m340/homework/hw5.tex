\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        FIS denotes the course textbook.
    \item
        Do not simply copy your answers from your classmates or the internet.
        You'll learn nothing from this. You will fail your quizzes and exams.
    \item
        You are encouraged to work with your classmates. Your answers
        should reflect your own work and understanding.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		Read 3.3 and 3.4 carefully
	\item
		(FIS 3.2) 6(b,e), 11, 14
	\item
		(FIS 3.3) 2(c,d), 3(c,d)
    \item
		(BONUS!! You don't have to turn this in.) Let $V=\mathbf{R}^n$ for some
		$n$. Let $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$ and $B=\{b_1,\ldots,b_l\}$ be linearly
		independent sets. Let $X$ be spanned by $A$ and $Y$ be spanned by $B$. Give an
		algorithm that computes a basis for $X\cap Y$.

		Hint: You can check your method agaisnt Problem 5 here:
