        FIS denotes the course textbook.

        Do not simply copy your answers from your classmates or the internet.
        You'll learn nothing from this. You will fail your quizzes and exams.
    \item
        You are encouraged to work with your classmates. Your answers
        should reflect your own work and understanding.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Practice computations of the determinant. Practice both the cofactor

        anything in for this.
