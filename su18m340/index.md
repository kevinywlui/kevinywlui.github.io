# Math 340 Su'18 Kevin Lui

## Office Hours

* Fridays. Right after class. Somewhere.

## Book

* Linear Algebra, 4th Edition Friedberg, Insel and Spence.
* I will reference this book and assign some problems from it.
* I realize that this is an expensive book. Do investigate cheaper purchasing
  options online such as [abebooks.com](abebooks.com). There are also copies
  you can request from the library.

## Important Dates

* 7/4 - No class
* Midterm
* 8/17 - Final

## Calendar


## Grading

Based on total class percentages, I will choose decide which percentages
correspond to a 4.0, the class median, 2.0, and 0.7. The rest of the grades
will decided using a piecewise-linear function.

* 20% Homework
* 20% Quizzes
* 25% Midterm
* 35% Final

## Homework

* There will be weekly homework due Monday. There is a grader for this course.
* The grader is allowed to reject any assignment if it is incomprehensible or
  illegible.
* Not all problems will be looked at. A few problems will are graded for
  correctness. A few problems will be graded for completion.
* The lowest homework score will be dropped.

## Quizzes

* There will be a short 15-minute quiz each Friday. 
* The lowest quiz score will be dropped.

## Makeup

* There will be a makeup quiz or exam only for well-documented, compelling, and
  unavoidable reasons. 
* You are expected to be here for the midterm and final.
  
## Outline 

* Roughly, we will go through Chapters 1-6.
* Topics include vector spaces, bases, linear transformations, matrix
  operations, determinants, eigen-stuff, inner products.
* This course is intended to be a second exposure to linear algebra. There will
  be an emphasis on proofs and rigor. But we will also cover applications and
  computations (with a computer).


## Articles

* [Introduction to Mathematical
  Arguments - Hutching](https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/proofs.pdf)

## Notes

Terrance Tao taught a linear algebra course with the same book. He has course
notes. I might follow his notes.
