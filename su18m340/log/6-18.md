## Introduction

* This class is about linear transformations.
* The goal of this course is to provide a deeper understanding on linear
  algebra.
* Application and computations.
* Course Outline
* Chapter 1 Vector spaces
* Chapter 2 Linear transformations
* Chapter 3 Matrix operations
* Midterm around here or before this?
* Chapter 4 Determinants
* Chapter 5 Diagoanlization
* Chapter 6 Inner products

## 1.2 Vector spaces

* Informally, a scalar is a quantity represented by a single number.
  For example, mass, speed, length.
* The scalars live in a field. This is not important. See appendix C. It is a
  number system where you can add, multiply, subtract, and divide.
  - R, C primary examples.
  - Q, finite fields
  - not Z or N
* Informally, a vector is a list of scalars that you can scalar multiply and
  add together. And a vector space is a set of vectors with some extra
  properties.
  - R^n, functions
  - can represent a few things, (age, weight, height)
* Defintion: A vector space is a set of elements (called vectors) with
  additional and scalar multiplication defined with these additional
  properties:
  - (VS 1) Addition commutes
  - (VS 2) Associativity of Addition
  - (VS 3) Existence of 0
  - (VS 4) Existence of inverses
  - (VS 5) 1 acts identically
  - (VS 6) (ab)x=a(bx)
  - (VS 7) a(x+y)=ax+ay dis p.
  - (VS 8) (a+b)x dis p.
* Examples
    - F^n for any field F
    - all functions 
    - continuous functions on R
    - set of matrices
    - polynomials of bounded degree
    - polynomials of any degree
    - nonexample, (x1, x2)+(y1, y2)=(x1-y1, x2+y2) 
    - nonexample, a circle
    - C is a 2-dimenisional real space
* We use 0 to denote many things in this class.
* We can write u+v+w without worry.
* Theorem: If x+y=x+z then y=z.
* Corollary: 0 and inverses are unique. make a minus sign comment here.
* Theorem: 0x=0, a0=0, (-a)x=-(ax)=a(-x), here -1 is addivitive inverse

## 1.3 Subspaces

* A subspace is a subset that is also a subspace.
* The whole space and the zero subspace are always subspaces
* A subset is a subspace if and only if these 3 conditions hold
* Examples
    - continous functions  > diff > smooth > polynomials  
    - symmetric matrices
    - nonexample, invertible matrices
    - come up with your own?
