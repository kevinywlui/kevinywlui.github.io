## Plan

* 1.5
* 1.6

## Remarks from 1.4

* In this class, we allow spans of infinite sets.
* Example, what is the span of $x^n$ inside the space of all functions?
* Vector spaces is a natural setting for linear transformations.
* Spanning and generating.

## 1.5  Linear independence

* Definition: A subset $S$ of a vector space $V$ is called linearly dependent
  if there exists a finite number of distinct vectors $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n$ in
  $S$ and scalars $a_1,\ldots,a_n$, not all zero, such that
  $a_1u_1+\cdots+a_1u_n=0$.
* A subset $S$ is linearly independent if it is not linearly dependent.
* Theorem: A subset $S$ of a vector space $V$ is linearly dependent if and only
  if there exists an element $u\in S$ such that $u\in span(S\setminus \{u\})$.
* (Spans don't grow if you add linearly dependent things.) Theorem: Let $S$ be
  a subset of a vector space $V$ and $A\subseteq span(S)$. Then
  $span(S)=span(S\cup A)$.
* (Linearly dependent means you have redundant elements) Corollary.
* Example: Give polynomial example
