## 1.6 Bases

- Defintion: A basis is a linearly independent and spanning set. The dimension
  is the cardinality of the basis.
- Does it exist? Is it unique? Is there any invariant?
- Examples:
    - Standard basis is ever basis is nice.
    - $F^n$, polynomial
- Theorem: Linear independence gives you unique representation.
- Theorem: Span gives you span.
- Theorem: Basis gives you both.
- Examples:
    - Do problem 3 in au17 final, both null and col
- In this course, in terms of basis, we are primarily interested in finite
  dimensional spaces.
- Theorem: If a space is finitely generated by $S$ then some subset of $S$ is a
  basis.
