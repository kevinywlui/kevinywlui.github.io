## 1.6 Bases

- Defintion: A basis is a linearly independent and spanning set. The dimension
  is the cardinality of the basis.
- Does it exist? Is it unique? Is there any invariant?
- Examples:
    - Standard basis is ever basis is nice.
    - $F^n$, polynomial
- Theorem: Linear independence gives you unique representation.
- Theorem: Span gives you span.
- Theorem: Basis gives you both.
