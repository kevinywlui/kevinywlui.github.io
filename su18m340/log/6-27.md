## 1.6 Bases and Dimension

- Theorem (Replacement Theorem): Let $V$ be a vectir spaces spanned by a set
  $G$ of cardinality $n$, and let $L$ be a linearly independent subset of $V$
  containing exactly $m$ vectors. Then $m\leq n$ and there exists a subset $H$
  of $G$ containing exactly $n-m$ vectors such that $L\cup H$ generates $V$.

    - Proof by induction on $m$. Base case: $m=0$....

    - Suppose the replacement theorem is true for some $m\geq 0$. We prove the
    theorem is true for $m+1$. Let $L=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{m+1}\}$ be a L.I. set.

    - The set $\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}$ is also linearly independent. So we can
    apply the induction hypothesis and deduce that there is a subset
    $\{u_1,\ldots,u_{n-m}\}$ of $G$ such that together they span $V$

    - This means $v__{m+1}$ is the span of the 2 sets. So we can deduced $n-m >
      0$

    - Also, we can deduce that some $u__i$ is not needed.

- Corollary: Suppose $V$ is a vector space having a finite basis. Then every
  basis for $V$ has the same number of vectors.

- Corollary: A L.I. (or spanning) set of top cardinality is a basis. L.I. sets
  can be extended.

- Subspaces have a lower dimension.

## 2.1 Linear transformations

- Define linear maps and their associated subspaces.
