## 2.1 Linear Transformation

- Recall a linear transformation is a map $T$ such that $T(x+y)=T(x)+T(y)$ and
  $T(cx)=cT(x)$.

    - We can also apply this to a general linear combination.
    - Differentiate and integration are examples.
    - Reflections, projections (there are multiple versions)
    - Translation is not an example.
    - Identity and zero transformations

- null space and kernel, range and image

- Theorem: these are subspaces

- image of subspaces T(W)

- prove rank-nullity. Pick a basis for null space and extend.

- One-to-one
