\section{2.4}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Define left and right inverses.
    \item
        A function has a left inverse if and only if it is one-to-one.
    \item
        A function has a right inverse if and only if it is onto.
    \item
        A linear transformation is an isomorphism if and only if it is
        bijective.
    \item
        A linear transformation is one-to-one if and only if the null space is
        trivial.
    \item
        A linear transformation is onto if and only if the rank is the
        dimension of the codomain.
    \item
        A linear transformation between equal dimensional space is an
        isomorphism if and only if it is either one-to-one or onto.
    \item
        The inverse of a linear function is linear.
    \item
        If there is a onto linear transformation then dimension things.
    \item
        Two finite dimensional spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have
        the same dimension.
    \item
        The $L(V,W)\cong M_{n\times n}(F)$.
