## Rank 

* The rank of a matrix is the rank of the corresponding linear transformation.
* Full rank is a thing.
* Full rank if and only if it is injective or surjective.
* Recall row operations is left-multiplication by an invertible matrix.
* The range does not change when pre-composing by an isomorphism. What if not
  isomorphic?
* The nullspace does not change when post-composing by an isomorphism. What if
  not isomorphic?
* Therefore, rank does not change under column and row operations.
* The range is the column space.
* Read Theorem 3.6 on your own. After row and column operations, every matrix
  decomposes as I's and O's.
* Corollary: rank is invariant under transposes.
* Method of computing inverses. M(A|I)=(MA|MI)
* Cosets and the first isomorphism theorem.
