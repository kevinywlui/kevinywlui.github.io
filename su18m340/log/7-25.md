## Plan 
* Finish 3.2
* 3.3
* 3.4

## 3.2
* Review: rank may decrease when you pre/post compose by a linear
  transformation. If the linear transformation is either sirujective or
  injective, sometimes it stays the same.
* Inverses work out nicely.

## 3.3
* Ax=b corresponds to a linear system.
* general solutions and particular solutions.
* Relationships among the columns detected in the null space.
* We can determine column space 
* We can determine null space.
* The row space is the perpindular complement of the null space. Since the null
  space doesn't change, neither does the row space.
* Solving (A|b)x=0 vs Ax=b.
