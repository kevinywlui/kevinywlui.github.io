## Plan 
* Finish Chapter 3
* Start motivating determinants
* Quiz

## Chapter 3

* Do example from midterm. Both range and nullspace.

## Determinants

* Determinant is a function whose magnitude is tells you about change in volume
  and whose sign tells you about change in orientation.
* Determiant as a function on the columns.
* Determinant is the unique n-linear alternating function whose value on the
  identity is 1.
* identity is reasonable.
* n-linear is reasonable.
* alternating is reasonable.
* if alternating then the switching.
