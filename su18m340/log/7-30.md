## Plan 

* Finish 4.5
* Compute some determinants if time

## 4.5

* Alternating implies switching rows give a minus sign.
* Corollary: if any two rows are the same, then the determinant is zero.
* n-linear implies scaling a row scales the determinant.
* If a matrix is singular then the determinant is zero.
* Adding a multiple of 1 row to another does not change rank.
* det(AB)=det(A)det(B) break into elementary
* det(A)= prod det(Ei) = prod det(Etranspose) = det(Atranpose) break into
  elementary
* Any 2 alternating n-linear functions that are 1 on the identity are the same.
  This proves uniqueness. It remains to prove existence.
  
## 4.2

* The determinant is defined recursively. Let tilde Aij be the matrix formed by
  deleting the i-th row and j-th column.
* determinant is cofactor expansion along the first row. The cofactor is the
  signed sub determinant term.
* det(A) = sum A1j c1j
* determinant is n-linear.
