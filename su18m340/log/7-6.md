# 2.2 Matrix Representation of a linear transformation.

- Crash course on matrix representations from $F^n$ to $F^n$.
- First we need to represent all vectors by vectors.
- Define ordered basis for any vector space. Both finite and infinite
  dimensional.
- We can write vectors with respect to this ordered basis and come up with the
  coordinate vector. 
- Consider $4x^3+2x^2+x+1=43 + 57 (-2 + x) + 26 (-2 + x)^2 + 4 (-2 + x)^3$ in
  $P_3(R)$ with respect to the 2 basis.
- If $\{v_j\}$ is a basis for $B$, then $T(v_j)=\sum__{i=1} ^m a_{ij} w_i$.
  The matrix is then $A=(aij)$.
- Matrix representation of linear transformations. Lower bracket is domain and
  upper is codomain.
- The space of linear transformations is a vector space.
- The bracket operation is a linear transformation.

# 2.3 Compositiion

- The composition of linear transformations is linear.
- Whenever compostion makes sense:
    - $T(U\sb{1} + U\sb{2}) = TU\sb{1} + TU\sb{2}$ and $(U_1+U_2)T=U_1+U_2T$.
    - $T(U_1U_2)=(TU_1)U_2$.
    - $TI = IT = T$
    - $a(U_1U_2)=(aU_1)U_2=U_1(a_U_2)$.
- These also holds for matrices.
- proof of matrix multiplication. In particular, the bracket is multiplicative.
