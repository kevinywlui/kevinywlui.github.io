# Plan

* Finish determinants

# Properties of determinants

* More remarks about multilinearity of determinants
* Determinant is alternating.
* This gives the cofactor expansion formula for any row 
* Determinants don't change under transpose.
* We can also use row reduction to compute determiants
* determinant of inverse is inverse of determinant
* Similiar matrices have the same determinant.

# Eigenvalues 

* Is there a basis where the matrix is diagonal.
* Define eigenstuff
* Finding the eigenvalue using determinants
* Charpoly
