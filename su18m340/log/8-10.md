* Cayley Hamilton is a thing

# 6.1 Inner Products

* Inner product is a generalization of a dot product, it only makes sense for
  subfields of C
* Complex conjugation is a thing
* The definition of inner product is that is is
    * Linear in the first component
    * (x,y) = conjugate of (y,x)
    * Together these 2 conditions is called sesquilinear
    * positive definite.
* Prop about inner product
    * conjugate linear in 2nd component
    * dotting with 0 gives zero.
    * (x,x)=0 if and only if x=0
    * (x,y)=(x,z) for all x implies y=z
* A vector space with an inner product is called an inner product space.
* Norms are a thing
* Prop about norms coming from inner products
    * absolute values of scalars pull out
    * norm zero iff zero
    * Cauchy Schwarz
    * Triangle
* Norm space
    * Definition
* Normalizing is a thing
* orthogonal is a thing
* Matrix representation.
