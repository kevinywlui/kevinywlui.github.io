# 6.2 Orthogonal basis

* Orthogonal basis is a thing
* Orthonormal basis is a thing
* Given an orthogonal basis, it is very easy to write a vector is terms of that
  basis. Even better if it is orthonormal. This agrees with standard basis.
* Given any finite dimension vector, you can constr
* Do example with (1,1)/sqrt(2), (1,-1)/sqrt(2) and (3,4)
* Talk about Fourier coefficients.
    * These are just the coefficients against an orthonormal basis.
    * exp(int) is orthonormal.
* Orthogonal complement is a thing. It is a subspace.
* The kernel is the orthogonal complement of the row space.
* Given any subspace of W of V. V is the direct sum of W and its orthogonal
  complement.
