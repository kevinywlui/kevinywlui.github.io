# 5.1

* eigenvectors are invariant under change of basis.
* charpoly is invariant under change of basis.
* A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if there is a basis for Fn consisting
  of eigenvectors for A.


# 5.2 Diagonalizbility 

* Conditions for when a matrix is diagonalizable
* Most of the time is it over CC.
* always diagonalizable with distinct eigenvalues.
* Split over F means you have n roots over F
* A polynomial with coefficients over C splits over C.
* If diagonalizable, then the charpoly splits.
* The algebraic multiplicity is a thing
* Eigenspace and geometric multiplicity is a thing
* Algebraic mulitplicty bounds geometric multiplicity
* sum of Eigenspaces give direct sum
* unions of linearly independent subsets of eigenspaces are still linearly
  independent.
* Diagonalizble if and only if algebraic mulitplicity equals geometric
  multiplicity.
