* Review the box
* Algebraic multiplicity bounds geometric multiplicity. Take a basis for the
  eigenspace. Extend.
* Let $T$ be a linear operator and $\lambda_i$ be distinct eigenvalues. For
  each $\lambda_i$, let $v_i\in E_{\lambda_i}$, then if $\sum v_i=0$, each
  $v_i$ is zero.
* Unions of linearly independent subsets from eigenspaces are still linearly
  independent.
* Diagonalizable if and only if algebraic multiplicity equals geometric
  multiplicity.
    - Proof: Let $m_i$ be algebraic multiplicity, $d_i$ be geometric
      multiplicity, and $n=\dim V$.
      
      Suppose diagonalizable. Then let B be a basis consisting of eigenvectors.
      Intersect this basis with each eigenspace. Call it $B_i$. Let $n_i=B_i$.
      Then $n\leq \sum n_i \leq \sum d_i \leq \sum m_i \leq n$.
      
      So $\sum (m_i-d_i)=0$. But each term  must be nonnegative.
      
      Conversely, suppose the multiplicties are equal. Then take union of
      eigenbasis. They form a basis for full space.
      
* Testing diagonalizability. Check splitting, check multiplicities. This also
  computes the diagonalization along the way.
* What are eigenvalues of derivative?
* Finite dimensional matrices always have eigenvalues if you extend the field.
* Give example of infinite dimension transform with no eigenvalues.
* Work through example 6 in book.

# Direct sums

* Define direct sum
* Give example
* Show Jasper's example to motivate
* Diagonalizable if and only if direct sum of eigenspaces
* The following are equivalent:
    * direct sum
    * sums and unique way of writing 0
    * unique way of writing any element
    * union of ordered basis for summands is ordered basis
    * exists order basis fof summands so that union is ordered basis.
* Do more examples
