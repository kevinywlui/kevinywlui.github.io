Name:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        What is a linear transformation? Is it a function?
        \vfill
    \item
        Prove that if $V$ is generated by a finite set $G$, then there is a
        subset of $G$ that is a basis for $V$. (Hint: If you claim a finite
        partially ordered set has a minimal or maximal element, you need to
        state why this partially ordered set is nonempty.)
