<p><strong>WebAssign/Book</strong></p>
<p>We will use <em>Linear Algebra with Applications, Second Edition</em> by Jeffrey Holt. You need a WebAssign access code to complete the homework. You can obtain this through the bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this course is to introduce students to matrix algebra. Topics include linear systems of equations, linear independence and span, linear transformations, inverses, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong></p>
<p>The class is curved in such a way that the median score will be around a 2.9 or 3.0. The grades will be weighed as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Category</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Weight</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Homework</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Midterm 1 (Week 4 - 4/26)</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Midterm 2 (Week 8 - 5/24)</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">20%</td>

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Final (Final Week - Jun 10)</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">40%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Homework</strong></p>
<p>The homework has 2 parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a Webassign part accounting for 15% of your total grade. The due dates for the Webassign homework will be posted on the Webassign page. I will add 5% to your Webassign grade unless you are above a 95%. In that case, you will receive a 100%.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a conceptual problem part accounting for 15% of your total grade. They are graded on completion. They will be a subset of the problems found here: &lt;https://sites.math.washington.edu/ m308/&gt; . The exact problem set will be written on the board in class and emailed to you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exams</strong></p>
<p>You are allowed the Ti-30x IIS calculator and a single sheet of 2-sided handwritten self written notes.</p>
<p><strong>Makeup Exams</strong></p>
<p>There will be no makeup midterm.</p>
<p>In the case of religious holidays or participation in certain university sponsored events, arrangements must be made as soon as possible. Otherwise, I will excuse you from an exam only in unavoidable, compelling, and well-documented circumstances. If you are extremely sick, you must bring me a doctor’s note that states you were incapable of taking the quiz or exam. If you are excused from a midterm, your other midterm and final will be weighed more heavily. If you are excused from final, you will receive an incomplete and will take a makeup final the following quarter.</p>
<p>If you are not excused and you miss an exam, you will receive a zero.</p>
