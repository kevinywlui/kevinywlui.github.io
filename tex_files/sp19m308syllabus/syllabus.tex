\textbf{Office Hours}
See the course page for office hours.

\textbf{WebAssign/Book}

We will use \textit{Linear Algebra with Applications, Second Edition} by
Jeffrey Holt. You need a WebAssign access code to complete the homework. You
can obtain this through the bookstore.

\textbf{Objectives}

The goal of this course is to introduce students to matrix algebra. Topics
include linear systems of equations, linear independence and span, linear
transformations, inverses, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.

\textbf{Grading}

The class is curved in such a way that the median score will be around a 2.9 or
3.0. The grades will be weighed as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ l r }
    Category  & Weight   \\
    \hline
    Homework  & 20\%      \\
    Midterm 1 (Week 4 - 4/26) & 20\%      \\
    Midterm 2 (Week 8 - 5/24) & 20\%      \\
    Final (Final Week - Jun 10)    & 40\%
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Homework}

The homework has 2 parts.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        There is a Webassign part accounting for 15\%  of your total grade.
        The due dates for the Webassign homework will be posted on the
        Webassign page. I will add 5\% to your Webassign grade unless you are
        above a 95\%. In that case, you will receive a 100\%.
    \item
        There is a conceptual problem part accounting for 15\% of your total
        grade. They are graded on completion. They will be a subset of the
        problems found here: <https://sites.math.washington.edu/~m308/> . The
        exact problem set will be written on the board in class and emailed to
        you.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Exams}

You are allowed the Ti-30x IIS calculator and a single sheet of 2-sided
handwritten self written notes.

\textbf{Makeup Exams}

There will be no makeup midterm.

In the case of religious holidays or participation in certain university
sponsored events, arrangements must be made as soon as possible. Otherwise, I
will excuse you from an exam only in unavoidable, compelling, and
well-documented circumstances. If you are extremely sick, you must bring me a
doctor's note that states you were incapable of taking the quiz or exam. If you
are excused from a midterm, your other midterm and final will be weighed more
heavily. If you are excused from final, you will receive an incomplete and will
take a makeup final the following quarter.

If you are not excused and you miss an exam, you will receive a zero.
