\textbf{Office Hours}
Office hours will be Tuesdays 3:00 - 4:00 and Wednesdays 1:00 - 2:00. They will
be held in Padelford C-8D.

\textbf{WebAssign/Book}

We will use \textit{Linear Algebra with Applications, Second Edition} by
Jeffrey Holt. You must have a WebAssign code to complete the homework. This
code gives access to a electronic version of the book. Dr. Andrew Loveless
wrote some really detailed instructions on WebAssign here:
\url{https://sites.math.washington.edu/~m124/WebassignInstructions.pdf}

\textbf{Objectives}

The goal of this course is to introduce students to matrix algebra. Topics
include linear systems of equations, linear independence and span, linear
transformations, inverses, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, and the Gram-Schmidt process.

\textbf{Grading}

The class is curved in such a way that the median score will be around a 3.0. I
will provide a grade estimate after each midterm.  The grades will be weighed
as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ l r }
    Category  & Weight   \\
    \hline
    Homework  & 20\%      \\
    Midterm 1 (Week 5 - 1/31) & 20\%      \\
    Midterm 2 (Week 8 - 2/21) & 20\%      \\
    Final (See MyUW)    & 40\%
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Homework}

The homework is done through Webassign. The due dates for the Webassign
homework will be posted on the Webassign page. I will add 5\% to your
Webassign grade unless you are above a 95\%. In that case, you will receive a
100\%.

\textbf{Exams}

You are allowed the Ti-30x IIS calculator and a single sheet of 2-sided
handwritten self written notes.

\textbf{Makeup Exams}

There will be no makeup midterm.

In the case of religious holidays or participation in certain university
sponsored events, arrangements must be made as soon as possible. Otherwise, I
will excuse you from an exam only in unavoidable, compelling, and
well-documented circumstances. If you are extremely sick, you must bring me a
doctor's note that states you were incapable of taking the quiz or exam. If you
are excused from a midterm, your other midterm and final will be weighed more
heavily. If you are excused from final, you will receive an incomplete and will
take a makeup final the following quarter.

If you are not excused and you miss an exam, you will receive a zero.
