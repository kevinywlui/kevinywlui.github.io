## Review Chapter 2 

* Review span and linear independence. Relate linear systems and matrices.
* Do the unifying theorem.
* Introduce the standard basis. Use it to understand matrix multiplication.
* Demonstrate that the difference of two solutions is a solution to the
  homogeneous system.

## Chapter 3.1 Linear Transformation

* Give definition of a linear transformation.
* Give both examples and nonexamples.
* Matrix multiplication is linear. All linear transformations come from this.
* Introduce range, relate to span and existence of solution.
* Introduce 1-1 and onto.
* Talk about span and linear independence again.
* Give the unifying theorem again.
* Show R2 to R2 visualizations.
