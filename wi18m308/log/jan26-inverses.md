## 3.3 Inverses

* A linear transfrmation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is equal to its inverse if equal to
  its own inverse.
* A square matrix $A$ is invertible if there exists $B$ such that $AB=I_n$.
* Give more examples of inverses we can figure out geometrically.
    * scaling
    * shear
* Properties of inverses. Assume $A,B$ invertible, then
    * $(A^{-1})^{-1} = A
    * (AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}
    * If $AC=AD$ then $C=D$.
* Derive method for computing. Explain both matrix multiplicatin version and
  linear map version.
* Do some basis examples.
* Give 2d formula
